    "## Procedural programming \n",
    "It structures code into procedures, sometimes called subroutines or functional sections of code. Because of this approach, the code is made up of logical steps to complete a specific task. Procedures can be reused by other parts of the code. Code is easy to understand because each procedure is broken into specific tasks. Procedural programming does have some disadvantages, including it can be hard to maintain and extend. In some cases, it doesn't relate well to real-world objects. Data is exposed throughout the whole program.\n",

    "Big O notation is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming that helps you analyze and describe the efficiency of algorithms.

This guide will explain Big O notation in simple terms with easy-to-understand Python examples.\n",

    "## What is Big O Notation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are cooking pasta, and you want to determine how long it will take to boil a pot of water. You might consider factors like the size of the pot, the power of your stove, and the amount of water you need to heat. Similarly, in computer science, algorithms are analyzed based on their efficiency when dealing with different sizes of input data.\n",

    "Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the upper bound or worst-case scenario for the time complexity of an algorithm. It helps us answer questions like:\n",

    "\n",
    "How does an algorithm scale with increased input size?\n",

    "## OOP Principles\n",
    "This reading introduces you to the OOP principles in more detail using some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object oriented paradigm was introduced in the 1960s by Alan Kay. At the time, the paradigm was not the best computing solution given the small scalability of software developed then. As the complexity of software and real-life applications improved, object oriented principles became a better solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "You previously encountered the four main pillars of object oriented programming. These are:  encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance and abstraction. Let's look at a few examples that demonstrate how these principles translate when using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "The idea of encapsulation is to have methods and variables within the bounds of a given unit. In the case of Python, this unit is called a class. And the members of a class become locally bound to that class. These concepts are better understood with scope, such as global scope (which in simple terms is the files I am working with), and local scope (which refers to the method and variables that are 'local' to a class). Encapsulation thus helps in establishing these scopes to some extent. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the Little Lemon company may have different departments such as inventory, marketing and accounts. And you may be required to deal with the data and operations for each of them separately. Classes and objects help in encapsulating and in turn restrict the different functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is also used for hiding data and its internal representation. The term for this is information hiding.  Python has a way to deal with it, but it is better implemented in other programming languages such as Java and C++. Access modifiers represented by keywords such as public, private and protected are used for information hiding. The use of single and double underscores for this purpose in Python is a substitute for this practice. For example, let's examine an example of protected members in Python."

Remember that everything in Python is inherently an object, so when I talk about polymorphism, it can be an operator, method or any object of some class.

The core of abstraction in Python is the implementation of something called abstract classes and methods, which can be implemented by inheriting from something called the abc module. \"abc\" here stands for abstract base class. It is first imported and then used as a parent class for some class that becomes an abstract class. Its simplest implementation can be done as below."
